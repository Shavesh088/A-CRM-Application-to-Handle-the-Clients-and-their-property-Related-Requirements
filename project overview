Project Overview : -
Dreams World Properties integrates Salesforce to streamline
customer interactions. Website engagement triggers automated
record creation in Salesforce, capturing customer details and
preferences. Salesforce categorizes users as approved or nonapproved, offering tailored propertyselections to approved users.
This enhances user experience and efficiency, providing
personalized recommendations and broader listings. Seamless
integration optimizes operations, improving customer engagement
and facilitating growth in the real estate market.
